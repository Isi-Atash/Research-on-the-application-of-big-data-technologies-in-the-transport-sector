Subject: “Research on the application of big data technologies in the transport sector”
	As evidenced by numerous global projects, big data is becoming a research focus in the transportation and logistics industry. Data will be generated in significant quantities by new technologies. They generate massive amounts of data that will significantly impact the design and implementation of transportation systems, making them safer, more efficient, and profitable. As a result, research into big data analytics in transportation is a burgeoning field. This paper begins by reviewing the history and characteristics of big data and transportation systems. Next, the big data analytics framework is discussed, including an overview of data sources and sampling techniques, data analytics techniques and systems, and big data analytics software categories. Because users share personal geo-localised data and content via their devices and computers, privacy is likely the most stringent security requirement imposed by Big Data-enabled transportation applications. As a result, we will discuss the unsolved threats to the transportation industry’s private data collection. Finally, this paper discusses some of the unsolved problems associated with big data technologies.
